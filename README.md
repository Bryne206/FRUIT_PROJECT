This project contains two hero section designs built with basic front-end tools.
Both pages share the same structure, but each one uses its own theme, color palette, and styling approach.

Nothing complex here — just improving my skills, experimenting with layouts, and translating visual ideas into clean, responsive code.

Files included:
• index.html – Fruity theme with a warm gradient
• apple.html – Alternate design with a different aesthetic
• Light JavaScript for the mobile navigation toggle

This repo is part of my ongoing practice in building interfaces from scratch and exploring simple UI patterns.
